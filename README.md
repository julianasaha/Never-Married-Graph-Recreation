This barplot compares the following two years, 2006 and 2016 to show an increase in the percenatge of people who have never been married. Each age range is compared between the two year's percentages and gender.

#### Improved Visualation
I decided to use a point plot to emphasize the increase between the two years. By removing the gender category and the comparison of both years in each age range, the graph was easier to read and understand the what the data was trying to represent.
